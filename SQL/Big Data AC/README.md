# Comprehensive Analysis and Application of Data Management Techniques in SQL and MongoDB

This report outlines my comprehensive exploration into the management and processing of structured and semi-structured data within SQL and MongoDB environments. Part of the Big Data Managing and Processing module, this work illustrates a hands-on approach to dealing with various data sets, emphasizing the adaptability required to navigate between different data paradigms effectively.

## Key Components of the Report

### Structured Data Processing with SQL

Utilizing the Sakila database within a MySQL environment, this section details my execution of a variety of SQL queries to:
- Count tables within the database.
- List films, along with formatting actor names.
- Filter data based on specified criteria.
- Aggregate information to reveal insights on film genres, rental frequencies, and revenues.

These SQL operations underscore the critical techniques for data manipulation and extraction inherent to structured database systems.

### Semi-Structured Data Handling with MongoDB

Transitioning to semi-structured data, this part showcases my proficiency with MongoDB operations, including:
- Setting up MongoDB Atlas.
- Creating databases and collections.
- Executing queries and aggregations for data projection, sorting, counting, and averaging.

My work with MongoDB exemplifies the platform's strengths in managing flexible schemas and highlights the analytical versatility of NoSQL environments.

### Reflection on Big Data Landscape Changes

The conclusion of this report presents a reflective analysis on the shifting landscape of big data. It explores differing viewpoints regarding:
- The balance between large-scale data collection and strategic, insight-driven analysis.
