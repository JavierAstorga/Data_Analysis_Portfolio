# SQL Report: Gaming and Hobby Store Database Management

This report outlines my work on creating and managing a database for a Gaming and Hobby Store as part of my assessment for the Databases and Business Applications module. The project encompasses the design, implementation, and manipulation of a database using SQL, aimed at analyzing data relevant to products, suppliers, customers, sales transactions, sales items, and employees.

## Key Activities

### SQL Queries Execution

A variety of SQL queries were executed to perform data extraction and analysis. These queries were aimed at:
- Counting tables within the database.
- Determining the number of invoices issued.
- Identifying customers named 'John'.
- Finding the longest album.
- Calculating the average track length.
- Identifying the artist with the most albums.
- Determining the top 5 artists based on sales.

### Database Design and Implementation

The database was meticulously designed to meet the operational requirements of the Gaming and Hobby Store. It features tables for:
- Products
- Suppliers
- Customers
- Sales transactions
- Sales items
- Employees

The design focused on important relational aspects, such as many-to-one relationships between products and suppliers, and one-to-many relationships between sales transactions and sales items.

### Data Population

Tables were populated using Data Manipulation Language (DML) to insert realistic and coherent data, ensuring the database accurately reflected the retail environment and supported effective analysis and decision-making.

### Advanced Data Manipulation

I crafted further SQL queries for:
- Displaying products priced above 100.
- Showing products alongside their supplier details.
- Identifying products bought by the top 5 customers.
- Determining the top 3 suppliers by product quantity.
- Finding the highest-value product in terms of sales.

These queries provided deeper insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and supplier performances.

### Analytical Queries

The database's analytical capabilities were further demonstrated through queries that:
- Summed total sales by month.
- Created a view to display customer purchases in October 2023.
- Deleted customers who never made a purchase.
- Listed customers whose names start with 'B'.
- Identified the top supplier in terms of product sales.

## Conclusion

This report encapsulates the extensive process of managing a specialized retail database, from its initial design and implementation to comprehensive data analysis. Through a series of structured SQL queries and sophisticated database management practices, it accentuates the significant role of database systems in optimizing retail operations, specifically tailored to the needs of a Gaming and Hobby Store.
