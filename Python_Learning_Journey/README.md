# Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python Learning Journey! This repository is a comprehensive collection of scripts, notebooks, and projects that chronicle my progression from a beginner to an advanced Python user. It encapsulates a wide range of topics including basic syntax, file handling, functions, lists, strings, loops, statistical analysis, and data manipulation with pandas, culminating in the final project for my master's program.

## Directory Structure

- **Basics**: Starter scripts that cover Python fundamentals such as variables, data types, and basic operators.
- **Files**: Examples on how to read from and write to files in Python.
- **Functions**: Scripts that demonstrate the definition and usage of functions to encapsulate code logic.
- **Lists & Strings**: A collection of scripts showcasing operations and manipulations on lists and strings.
- **Loops**: Various examples of using loops (for, while) in Python for iterating over data structures.
- **Statistics**: Scripts focused on statistical analysis, leveraging Python's built-in functionalities and statistical libraries.
- **Pandas**: Notebooks demonstrating data manipulation and analysis using the pandas library, including data cleaning, processing, and visualisation.
- **Final Master's Project**: The capstone of this journey, a comprehensive project that combines all the learned techniques to solve a real-world problem using data analysis.

## Objectives

The primary goals of this learning journey have been to:
- Understand and apply the basics of Python programming.
- Develop proficiency in data manipulation and analysis.
- Implement statistical analysis techniques in Python.
- Complete a meaningful project that demonstrates the acquired knowledge and skills.

## Final Master's Project

The final piece of this collection is the project I completed for my master's degree. It involves a prime number checker that validates the primality of a given integer, a utility for appending golf tournament participants and their scores to a text file, a script for reading and displaying these scores, and two data visualisation examples that plot the distribution of monthly expenses using a pie chart. Additionally, it features a telephone number translator that converts alphabetic characters in phone numbers to their numeric equivalents, adhering to standard telephone keypad mappings. Each script showcases practical applications of Python programming, including file handling, user input processing, and the use of libraries for data visualisation.
