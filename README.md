## Exploring the Portfolio

This portfolio has been structured to ease navigation and showcase a broad spectrum of my competencies. Here's how you can explore it:

1. **Start with your area of interest:** Each directory (Machine Learning, Python, SQL, Tableau) is dedicated to a specific skill set. Feel free to jump into whichever catches your eye first.
2. **Review README files:** Each project directory contains a detailed `README.md` that provides an overview of the project, my approach, key findings, and insights. This will give you a good starting point and context for exploring the projects.
3. **Dive into the code:** After reading the READMEs, delve into the scripts and notebooks. They are commented and organized for readability and understanding.
4. **Check the visualizations:** For projects under Tableau, screenshots and links to interactive dashboards are provided when possible, offering a direct view of the analytical outcomes.
